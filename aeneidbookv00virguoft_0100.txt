449—1da: the pina os Ida were osten celebrated by the poets ε Eurip.
Hec. 629: A. 9, S): Tennyson, Oenone: ‘⁶ They mme, they cut
away my tallest pines, My dark tall pines that plumed the craggy
ledge.''—raalicibus ε “ by the roots :'’ abl. of separation: Η. 413 ;
A. ἁ G. 243.

450—Studiis: “in their excitenrent.” In prose we should have either an
{d} as ειιηὲιηιὶἰ limiting studiis, or cum: H. 419, Ι, [J. 3 A. & G.
51 a; 24 ‚ .

45l—Caelo=a‹l caelum: H. 385, 11, 4, 1 ); A. & G. 225, b. It is just
possible that in poetry certain words are used with the adverbial
termination-0 to denote motion towards or to a place: cp. the
adverbs citro, ultro, intro, retro, porro.

452—Mz'seram. Distinguish in meaning and construction z misereor and
miseror: v. 350.

453—At. Note ν. 35.—non--ira ε “the hero not dispirited nor daunted
by the fall returns bolder to the figln and rage nerves his strength.”
—tardatus may also refer to physical movement. Distinguish m‘s
and vires in meaning : see next verse.

455- Tum—tota ε “ then, at length, shame and the consciousness ot
merit gives fire to his might and furiously he drives Dares head-
long over the whole plain.'' It may be pointed out that is vires is
the plural os vis, the latter does not conform to the usual method
of forming the nominative singular. Vires presupposes a nom. sing.
vers or vir, as 8 disappears aster r: cp. patere, pater ‚· victora, ric-
tor, and not r before 8. There is also the difficulty with respect to
meaning, vis generally signisying‚ “sorce,’' “ attack '’ with the idea
of “violence'': vires “strength'' Vis is connected with Fac:
γΓις, the Foccasionally disappearing as in βίος, Βιόωε cp. vivo:
qvivo, vix, vivo, viyeo : queck, quick ; in Ger. omnicken, quicksilber:
Eng. quick (the quick and the dead), while vires (though some say:
vises) is more probably connected with the same root as we find in
vir, viryo, vireo, vireas—toto aequore: H. 425, 11, 2 ς Α. δι G.
254, a.

457—Nunc—-sini3traz “look you, showering blows now with hisright
hand, now with his left.''—ille : here serves to keep prominently
before the reader the person spoken of ε cp. ὅγε.

458—Quam—Dareta: “as many as are the hailstones that the storm
clouds send clattering on the housetops, even so thick are the blows
with which the hero again and again with both hands buffets and
sends Dares spinning.''—quam multa ε we should have expected in-
stead os sic in εἰσ densis, tam, to balance the quam—culminibus
sor the omission os in ε see Verg. G. 1, 449, where in is expressed
in a similar image. With the whole passage, cp. Scott's description
