90 vnnom's AEN. n. v.

arduus = cp. arrectus in diqitos z ν. nodutim, scil, euentus
Some MSS. omit in, then ossa is direct object and cerebro is a
dative. In that case, it (final) in illisit is long (see Papillon's Phil·

ology‚ page 175.).

481—Sternitur—bos ι “ liseless the ox is laid low and writhing lia on the
ground.” Exanimis: what adjectives are heteroclitic? H. 159,
111 ; A. δι G. 87. fi—humi z what examples of locutive in Latin?
H. 426, 23 A. δι G. 258, d.—bo⁸. The monosyllabic ending is
no doubt intended to express the heavy thud of the ox as he falls to
the ground. Vergil generally in the case of a monosyllabie ending
keeps up the interest by withholding the nominative to the end:
cp. vex-g. G. 1, ¹8¹3 1, 2475 A. 2, 2503 3, 390.

483-uHanc-persolvo ι “ this is a better life that Ι offer to thee, Ο Eryx,
as a substitute sor (that of) Dares,'’ literally, “sor the death of
Dares.''—meliorem z “ better” either because the life of an animal
was involved and not that of a man: or, because some contempt
sor Dares is meant= Dares could not withstand me, but this
bull did ; or, in allusion to a Greek custom‚ when a first victim
failed to satisfy, a second was substituted with the exclamation
δευτέρων ἀμεινόνων.

485—Prolinus. Grammarians make an artificial distinction between pro·
tenus and protinus, resering protenus to place, protinus to time.
Both are derived from porro lenus 3 prozrrbbho, ‘⁴ forward ;'’ tenus,
root ΤΑΝ, nivo, ten-do, and mean “ without inter1·uption,'' '‘imme-
diately.'' With the archery match of Vergil compare that oi Homer
(ΙΙ. 23, 850 sqq.), in which the competitore were Teucer and Meri·
ones· Teucer euts the cord and Meriones kills the bird and wius
first prize. With this and the next line cp. v, 291, 292.

«iffi—Ingenti manu: either “ with a strong hand” (cp. v. 241) as a hero
would naturally have, or “ with a strong crew of men.”—malum .·

distinguish this in meaning from malum.

488- Volucrem—columbam: “a dove fluttering at (the end of) a cord
passed across (round) its leg.”-trajecto: may also mean “passed
round the mast,'’ or “across the dove.''—in sunez the usual con·
struction would befune legatam .· “ bound by a cord. ”

489—Quo—serrum ε “ (a mark) to which they may direct their shaft.”—quo
=ut eo: the subjunctive of purpose ε H. 497, 1.; A. δι G. 317.

490- Viri : ‘⁸ competitors.”-disjectam—sortem: “the tots thrown into
it.” The sing. is here used for the plural. So in Homer (11. 23.
861) the competitors choose lots.

491—-Et—H1ppocoontis ε “ and the first lot that comes out before all other
was that of Hippocoon, the son os Hyrtacus.''—exit ς arather woek
substitute sor the Homeric ἐξέθορε. Hippocoon was brother of
Nisus, but otherwise unknown.

by this title, though only second. Translate “a prizeman.”
