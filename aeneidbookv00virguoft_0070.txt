'Io—Meritaeque-palmae ε “ and let thern expect to get the prizes earned
by victory‚'' litenlly, “of well-earned vietory.'' Here palmae:
victoriae : cp. Hor. Od. 4, 2, 173 Quos Elea domum reducit Palma
caelestes. A wreath of date palm, though in early times an emblem
os victory among the Greeks does not seem to have been adopted
as such by the Romans till late. Livy x. 47, (speaking of the
year Βὸ C. 293) says ε palmae primum, translato e Graecia more,
victori us dacae.

7l—Ore favete: “avoid all ill-omened words ”3 literally, “favour with
your mouth.'' Festus, p. 88, says ε “ Favere enim est bona fari ‚-
at veteres poetae pro silere usi sunt favere. The expression ore
favere means (1) keep silent, or (2) speak words of good omen.
We have various forms of this command: favete linguis animisque
(Ovid F. 1, 71); save linqua (Tib. 2, 2, 2); oresavete (Hor. od. 3,
1, 2). Compare the Greek expressions : εὐφημεῖτε, εὔφημος ἔστω.
Special care was taken during a sacrifice that no inauspicious word
or frivolous expression should escape the lips of the bystanders:
hence the admonition of the priests. Improper expressions were
supposed not only to pollute the sacrifice, but to bring ill-luck to
the object os the feast.—Gin9ue—ramis: those who offered sacri-
fices generally wore garlands around their heads, and sometimes
carried them in their hands.

72—Macerna—myrto. The myrtle was especially dear to Venus, the
mother of Aeneam cp. V. Eclog. 7, 62; araci-ssim Formosae

73—Aevi-macuru3: “ripe in years‚’' i.e. advanced in age. Λευὶ is the
genitive of respect: M. 290, g3 H. 399, 111.: A. ὼ G. 218 c.; or
a locative: cp. belli, humi, domi. H. 426, 23 A. ἅ G. 218 c.
Cp. Bacon's ‘⁶ Rosea are fast fiowera of cheir smell.''

74—Sequicur—pubes2: “whose example the rest of the youths imitate.''
For this meaning of sequor ε cp. Cic. Lael. 12, 41.: Tiberius Grac-
chus reynum occupare conatae est. Hunc pose mortem secuti amici.
