tantorum: predicate.—-ter9a—b0um. Decline these words, giving

full forms.

406--lon9eque—recu3at: “ and at a (safe) distance he declines.” Others
interpret lonye by valde or diu. The idea seems to be, however,
that Diores recoils at a distance from the caestus and declines the
contest.

407—E't—ver3at: “both tries the weight and turns in his hands on this
side and on that the huge twisted thongs of the gloves.'' Note the

Rhegium, one of the oxen plunged into the sea and swam over to
Sicily, where Eryx caught it and put it among his own cattle.

Hercules went to Sicily to recover it. Hence the fight iu which
Eryx was killed by Hercules.

414-H23—senectas: “in these (gauntlets) he stood against the powerful
Hercules. To these was I trained, while a more generous blood
