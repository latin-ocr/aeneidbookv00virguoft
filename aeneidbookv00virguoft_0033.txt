assembly and reminds his followers that just one year had
elapsed since the death of his father Anchises, and, at the
same time he announces his intention of celebrating that event
by annual sacrifices to be followed nine days afterwards by
games, consisting of (l) a sailing-match: (2) a foot-race: (3)

and glides back to its hole. Aeneas, doubtful as to what to

were on the point of rounding the rock, Menoetes, who was

sea and takes the helm himself.

taurus in rounding the rock hugs it too closely, breaks her
oars, and runs her prow aground. Cheered on by Mnestheus
the crew of the Pristis increase their efforts and lightly skim
