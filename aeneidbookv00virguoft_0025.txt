Crutwell thus defends Vergil in regard to the main charge ε ἔῧεςζῑηῑω
“The Aeneid was meant to be, above all things, a national
poem, carrying on the lines of thought, the style of speech,
which national progress had chosen 3 and it was not meant to
eclipse, so much as to do honor to, early literature. Thus
those bards who, like Ennius and Naevius, had done good
service to Rome by singing, however rudely, her history, find
their imayz'nes ranged in the gallery of the Aeneid. Thus
they meet with the flamens and pontiffs, who drew up the
ritual formularies 3 with the antiquarians and pious scholam,
who had sought to find a meaning in the immemorial names,
whether of place or custom or person 3 with the magistrates,
novelists and philosophem, who had striven to ennoble and
enlighten Roman virtue, with the Greek singers and Sages,
for they, too, had helped to rear the towering fabric of Roman
greatness. All these meet together in the Aeneid, as in
solemn conclave, to review their joint work, to acknowledge
its final completion‚ and to predict its impending downfall.

by Pope‚ who says that the poem had as much a political
object as Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel 3 that its primary
object was to praise Augustus, and the secondary one was to
flatter the Romans by dwelling 011 the splendor of their
origin. “ Augustus is evidently typified under the character
of Aeneas, both are cautious and wise in counsel3 both are
free from the perturbations of passion3 they were cold‚ un-
feeling‚ and uninteresting3 their wisdom and policy were
wordly-minded and calculating. Augustus was conscious
that he was acting a part, as his last words show 3 and the
contrast between the sentiment and conduct of Aeneas, when·
ever the warm impulses of affection might be supposed to
have sway, likewise created an impression of insincerity.

The characteristic virtue which adorus the hero of the Aeneid
as the epithet pius, so constantly applied to him shows, was
final piety, and there was no virtue which Augustus more
