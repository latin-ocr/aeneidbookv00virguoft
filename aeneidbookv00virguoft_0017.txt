LIFE OF VERGI L.

Publius Vergilius Maro¹ was born on the fifteenth of Birth-
October, B.C. 70, in the first consulate of M. Licinius Crassus

and Cn. Pompeius, at Andes, (now Piecola), a small village
near Mantua. Since the full franchise was not given to this
part of Gaul (Gallia Transpadana) till some years after·
wards⁹‚ the poet, like many of his predecessors and contem-
poraries in literature, was not a Roman, but an Italian

provincial.⁸

The parents of Vergil, like those of Horace, were of His parents.
obscure birth. Some authorities say that the poet's father
was a potter, others, that he was a brickmaker, while others
again assert that he was the servant of a travelling merchant,
Magius, whose daughter, Magia Polla, he afterwards married.
Whatever may have been his occupation, certain it is, that
he was at the time of the poet's birth, the steward‚ factor, or
possessor of an estate near Mantua. The childhood of
Vergil was passed amid the hills and woods that fringed
the verdant banks of the Mincius, and the early association of
the poet with the lovely scenery of the neighborhood of his
native town may account for the exquisite touches of pas-
toral life which is so well depicted in the Eclogues and

the Georgics.
