same subject that has ever appeared. The harmonious and Beavfties {2s
graceful language, the pleasing descriptions of rural soenes, the mmmm.
the apt and charming episodes, all combine to lend an

interest to a subject, which in any other hands would have

been intolerably dull. The time was ripe for such a poem.
Agriculture had been the chief employment and the honored
occupation of the Romans from the early days of the

City. The long-continued wars had, however, desolated

Italy‚²¹ and Vergil with sorrow laments‚ “ the plough hath

not its meed of honor, the fields lie neglected, and the

tillers are off to the war3 the crooked pruning hooks are

forged into stiff swords.’'²² Even after war had ceased,‚the

soldier, too long accustomed to camps and the excitement of a

military life, cared little about the prosaic life of a farmer.

To recall the peaceful habits of rural industry, the poem,

which Addison pronounces “the most complete, elaborate

and finished piece of all antiquity,'' was written. The first Gon'eztts Os
book treats of tillage, the second of orchards„ the third of the Georyzcs.
care of horses and cattle, and the fourth of bees. The two

most successful imitations in English of this poem are Philips’s
Pastorals‚ and Thompson‘s Seasons. Yet, no one can read

the English imitations without being struck with their in-

feriority to the poem of Vergil.

The Aeneid‚²³ in twelve books, written between 29 Re. Aemia.
and 19 Rc.. recounts the story of the escape of Aeneas from
burning Troy, his wanderings over the deep in search of a
home which the fates had promised, his final settlement in
Italy as the founder of the Roman Empire destined in after
ages to rule the world. No doubt, Vergil, borrowed largely

from the Greek and Roman writers who preceded him. The Vergil

π The first notice of the Aeneid that we have is in a letter of Vergil to Augustus,
written probably B.C. 236, when the latter was on an expedition against the Canta·
brians. De Aenea quide-m meo, si, mehercule jam diynum auribus haberem tuis, libenter
