PREFACE.

 

The present edition is designed to meet the wants of students reading
for Second Glass Oertificates and University Pass M atriculation. The
notes have been purposely made copious and full. When it is remem-
bered that Vergil is usually put into the hands of a school boy at a
very early period of his course, and that the Aeneid is really a difficult
book for a junior pupil, no apology need be offered for the assistance
given in this edition. The principa] object of the notes is to explain
the grammatical difficulties that occur. The latest edition of Hark-
ness's Latin Grammar (Standard Edition of 1881) is referred to. In
regard to Orthography‚ though some forms not usually met with in
ordinary editions have been introduced, the readings of Ribbeck have
not, as a whole, been adopted. The pupil would be puzzled if we were
to read e. g. omnis (acc. pl.) in one line, and omnes in the next, for the
same case. The letter j throughout has also been retained. Pupils
will never learn to appreciate Vergil, if teachers bether them with nice

questions of Latin orthography, which, in many cases, are still in
dispute.

The editions of Conington, Kennedy and Creenough have been con·
sulted in preparing the notes for this edition.
