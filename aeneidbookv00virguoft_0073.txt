Mnestheus, second, in the Pristis ; Gyas, third, in the Chimaera.
In this contest Cloanthus received a cloak embroidered with gold ς
Mnestheus, a corslet 3 Gyas,¹ a pair of brazen cauldrons and drink-

second, and Dares, third ; Salius and Nisus follow. All receive a

contest (484· 544), in which Acestes gains the first prize‚ a wreath and
a wine mixer; Eurytion, the second ; Mnestheus, the third ς Ηίρ-
