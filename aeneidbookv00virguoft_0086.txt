ebo-chlamydem auratamz “a mantle embroidered with gold.” Th< Greek
χλαμύς (chlamy-3) was a woolen garment os an oblong shape (its
length being twice its breadth), worn loosely around the shoulders
and fastened in sront by a brooch (περόνη, Lat. sibecho—Quam circum
:circum quam, by anastrophe.—Plurima—Meciboea: “many a
strip os Meliboean purple with a double wavy edge.'' Here the
limbus, or edge, of the cloak is called (by antonomasia) Maeander,
from its resemblance to the twists and turns of the River Maeander
which divides Lydia from Caria, in Asia Minon--Melc'boeat said
to be derived srorn (1) a town in Thessaly; (2) an island at the
mouth osthe River Orontes, in Asia.

who hotly pursues on leafy Ida the fleet stags with his Javelin.'’—
Intentus, scil. ei, i.e., chlamydi ; H. 386 ς Α. & G. 228. The pue-r
is here Ganymede, son of Tros, an ancient king of Troy. The rep·
resentation of the story ol Ganymede on the border os the mantle
may have been suggested by Homer’s account os the baldric of Her-
cules (Οά. 11, 6¹0).—Ida .· local abl.; H. 4255 A. & G. 254.—
Faciyat: a zeuqma ‚· literally, “ pursues them with his javelin and ·
wearies them out in the chase.”

251—Praepes: ‘¹ niml›le.” It is probable that two scenes are here repre·
sented—Ganymede hunting and Ganymede carried away by the
eagle. In Homer (ll. 20, 23 3· 5.) Ganymede is represented as mrried
off by the gods to act as a cup-bearet to Jove, while in Homer's
Hymn to Venus (v. 203) he is said to h'ave been caught up to heaven
in a storm. Later poets represent him as carried off by Jove, who
transformed him into an eagle.

“ on high.”)—Jovi⁸ armiyer=aquila. With pedibus uncie. ς cp.

257—Saevicque—aura3: “ and fierce is the baying os the hounds towards
the sky ;” or taking saevit latram canum=3aevium ,latrantes canes:
‘⁸ fiercely the baying hounds howl towards heaven ’⁹ (by enallaqe), as
the eagle glides from their sight. The preposition in expresses di-
rection, and also gives the idea of the object against which the bark
is directed.

258 -At-armis: ‘⁸ but (to him) who next gained a second place by his
merit, to that hero he gives a hauberk (woven) with smooth
clasps. and thrice laced with gold, which the victor himself had
stripped from Demoleus, on the banks of the rapid Simois, 'neoth
losty Troy.''— Virtute: with virtue, cp. the use of ἀρετὴ. In the
Iliad (23, 265) the second prize in the chariot raceis an unbroken
horse (ἵππος ἅδμὴτης).-8εεη this line and tell what metrical figure.

The Roman hastati wore mail cuirasses. Vergil on other occasions ,

mentions these as fonned os golden rings, linked together (A. 3467 3
