Homer (Od. 11, 26), or of honey and oil, or wine (Il. 23, 170, 220).
Distinguish carchesium‚ a large drinking cup with two handles and
ornamented with figures (καρχήσιον) ; crater, a sort of punch bowl,
in which the liquor was mixed (κεράννυμι) ; poculum, a general
term for a drinking cup.——-Hmni, a locative: cp. ruri, belli, foci,
ibi, ubi, vesperi, mani.

79-Furpureos: “bright :'' ep. πορφύρεοςι Eng. purple which, (see Marsh's
Lectures, p. 69) inc¹uded all colors from scarlet to dark violet.
The flowers were strewed in garlands round the base of the tomb.

80—Salve: “ peace be with thee :'' ep. χαῖρε. Servius says that the
address to the dead at the tomb was repeated thus: salve, salve,
ter resalve: cp. A. 6, 506: Mayna manes ter voce vocavi: Cp.
Hom. Od. 9, 65. It seems that vale was also used3 cp. Α. 11, 98.
It seems doubtful whether iterum should be connected with salve or
aalvete. The colon is placed by some before, by others after, iter-
um. If the latter reading is adopted, the reference is to the second
visit to the tomb of his father, who died at Drepanum in Sicily
(A. 3, 710). Other authorities locate the tomb of Anchises on Mt.
Ida; at Pallene, on the Thermaic gulf; in Arcadia 3 or in Italy.
—Recepti‚ scil, patris: “ of my father rescued to no purpose‚” from
the ruins os Troy. Others take the worcl as agreeing with cinere-s.
Distinguish frustra, “in vain,'’ disappointed hope of the subject ;
ngquidquam, ‘⁶ to no purpose‚” referring to the nullity in which the
t ing ended.

Sl—According to an old Scholiast, Vergil bere refers to the three parts of
man ι the dust (cineres) that returns to the earth; the soul (anima)

pr gital principle ς and the {Q (umbra) that returns to the spirit
an .

82-Non—Thybrim: “’twas not the will ol heaven for me to seek with
thee the lands of Italy and the destined fields and the Ausonian Tiber,
whatever that may be.''-licuz'c: generally licet means what is al·
lowed by human law = (ὁεῖ); fas esc (-—- χρὴ) what is lawsul in the
sight of heaven. Here licuit =fa3 erac.-—Quicmn(1ueest .· accord·
ing to Servius this remark is made, because Aeneas had not seen
the river, or because of his weariness at the length of his voyage.
Thybrim t Vergil used 'l'hybr-is (gen.—idi8) Tiberis, Tiberinus
(adj.) to suit his convenience.

84—D1'xerat—aras: “he finished his speech, when from the inmost re·
cesses of the holy tomb, aslimy serpent carne gliding, trailing seven
folds‚ seven coils, gently twining around the mound, and passing
lightly o'er the altars.''—adytis: only the priest and the initiated
had access to the shrine; (adytum from a, “ not ’² and δῦναι, “ to
enter''). The holy parent (sanctus parens) had made the tomb
hallowed.—an9uis: the ,qenins loci, especially of a tomb, is often
represented by a serpent.—Septem—septena. There seems to be
here a confusion in the use the cardinal and distributive adjectiva.
Explain what would be the usual meaning of septena volumina.
There is perhaps no difference between 931⁷·oe and volumina. Wag-
ner sees here a hendiadys, as if Vergil had said ε κρεσιη pyros in ne
replicatos.
