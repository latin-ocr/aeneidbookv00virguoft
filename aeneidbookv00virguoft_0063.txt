noma. 51

lo—Olli: an intentional archaism=illi (both dat. sing. and nom. pl.)
occurs five times in this book, mostly as the first. and last word of a
line. When it is in the middle of a line, olli is the first word in a
sentence: cp. olim. The Alexandrian grammarians defended the
use of archaisms in Epic poetry. Vergil uses the following: (1) in
nouns, a'i=ae, gen. sing. of tst decl. in such words as terra,
aqua, aula, aura, (2) u=ui, in the dat. sing. of 4th decl. victu:
victui: (3) e for ei in the 5th decl. fldezfidei: (2) in verbs: (a),
the use of the close form of the impf. indic. of 4th conj. lenibat:
leniebat ,· (b), ier, for inf. pass, defendier-:defendi ,⁰ the contracted
form sor perf. subj. and fut. perf. indic. act.: fczxitzfecerit : faxo:

ll—Noctem—ferens: “bringing with it gloom and foul weather.'’-2·n-
hemia—tenebris: “and the sea grew rough with the darkness.’'
What case is tenebris ,9 Note the force of the inceptive inhorresco.
The poet refers to the dark appearance of the water produced by a
squall ι cp. Od. 12, 406 ς ἢχλυσε δὲ πόντος ὑπ’ αὐτῆς.

12—-Ipse Palinurus, scil, ait: “ even Palinurus says’' ε the storm was so
severe that even the the pilot became alarmed.—9ubemator, called
rector (161), maqister (867), “ the pilot‚” as opposed to the ductor,

‘⁵ captain.”

13—Quianam: here and in A. 10, 6, according to Festus an archaism for
quare or cur. Note the force of the suffix—nam: cp. quisnam,
Trans ε “ Ah Ι Why, pray, have such clouds o'ercast the sky.”

14—Quidve-para3: “ or what, Ο F ather Neptune, have you in store ἰ’ ”
The pilot would naturally pray in danger to his patron deity, as
soldiers did to Mars, poets‚ to Apollo or to Bacchus—pater among
the Greeks and Romans seems to have been a general epithet of a
nver -or sea-god ε cp. Hom. Il. 14, 201, ὠκεανόν τε θεῶν γένεσιν;
11. 18. 36, πατὴρ γέρων, applied to Nereus : Pater Tiberinus, Livy.
2. 10: Oceanus pater, Verg. G. 4, 386. It was a favorite dogma
of the Ionic school of philosophy that water was the primary element
of all things—a doctrine held evidently by Vergil. (Verg. G. 4,
382). Deinde: join this with jabet. Scan this line and tell what
metrical figure is in it ε Η. 608. III.; A. & G. 347. c.

in Od. 2, 390, 423, 430 ; 12, 410. The usual phrase would be vela
contrahere=26rca ὑποστέλλειν. As vasa colliyere is a military term
“ to pack up baggage '' preparatory to a march (Livy 21, 47 ; 27, 47),
we may suppose that Vergil had a military rather than a nautical
phrase in his mind.—validisque-remis .· “ and with vigor to bend t ›
the oars '' ; validis is adverbial (=valide by enallage) rather tha1
an epithet of remi-s. With incumbere remis .· cp. the Homer10
