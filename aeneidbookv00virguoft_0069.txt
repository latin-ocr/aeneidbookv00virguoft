ez—Adhibete-Aceetesx “invite to the feast both our country’s house-
hold gods and those whom our host Acestes worships.’' Penates
were deities that presided (1) either over the state (publici), (2) or
over the family (privati). They seem to have been founders either
os the clau or of the family. 'l'he word is from ΡΑ, “to seed:'' cp.
pater, panis, penus, πατήρ, ndum—Ihm& ς decline sully this word,
and tell others that belong to the same class : H. 143, 3 ς A. ἃ G.
79, b. What case is epulis? H. 3865 A. & G. 228.

effa-aeterea—classis: “further, when the ninth morn raisoe its genial
light to mortals, and with the beams of the sun reveals the world,
the first contest that Ι shall propose sor the Trojans will be one of
fast-sailing ships.’' Si=quum‚ with the idea of supposition added
to that ot time : H. page 281 footnote 2. Cp. German wenn, which
involves both id εει-ς. Nona, the mourning and solemnities connected
with the dead lasted for nine days after the funeral, after which a
sacrifice was made and a feast held called Novemliale (see Dict.
Antiq), Among the Greeks also the chiefsacrifice (τὰ ἔνατα or ἑννατα)
was on the ninth day aster death ε cp. Hom. ll. 24, 6643 ἐννῆμαρ
μέν κ’ αὑτὸν ἐνὶ μεγάροις γοάοιμεν. Orbem, some take this to mean
“the world‚” sor which the usual expression is orbis terrae or terra-
rum; others, the disc of the sun. With the phrase ponere certamina:
cp. τιθέναι ἀγῶναςε Aesch. Ag. 845.

67-Quique—caestu: “and he who is strong in the foot·race, and he
who bold in his strength proudly bears himself as superior (to
the others), either in hui-ling a dart or in shooting light arrows, or
if any one dares to engage in a contest with the gauntlet of raw
hide.'' Pedum cursui sor the genitive, M. 280, obs. 1. Viribus
audam cp. the Homeric βίῃ πεποιθώς. Incedit: this verb, as well
as its derivative noun incessus, expresses a dignified bearing; cp.
A. 1, 463 ast eqo quae divum incedo reqina: A. 1, 405, et vera
incessu patuit dem—Mais, levae, distinguish—Aut and seu are used
here as equivalents ; cp. A. 12, 685, 686. The distinction between
them generally is that aut (which is really the same word as haut,
haud, not) separates words really different, and is employed in
questions which imply an objection or a negation, or in expressing
opinions of disapprobation. When we wish to keep the ideas
separate and distinct, seu ( =si ve) marks an unimportant hypo·
thesis (πεί vis, or if you rather will), or one merely of name.

the amatus it may mean “ untanned.'’—fidit,=audet ε conjugate fido
and give other verbs of the same class. It is not usual to find fido
with int. pres, without an acm—caestu. The caestus was a strip ot
untanned bull's hide wound round the hands and arms, with balls
of lead or iron sewed in. It is described by Homer ( ΙΙ. 23, 684 )
ἵμαντας ἐϋτμήτους βοὸς ἅγραὺλοιο. The order of the contest given
here is different from that mentioned in the subsequent part of the
book. There the order is : (1) the ship race (v. 104) ; (2) the¹ foot-
race (v. 286) ; (3) the boxing match (v, 362); (4) the archery game
