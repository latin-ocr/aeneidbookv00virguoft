l—Interea. AEneas sailed from Karthage at day-break (A. 4, 584), but
was prevented by northerly winds from making headway‚ and when
night drew near, he was still within sight of land. The whole space
of time between day-break and night is implied in interea. Interim,
on the other hand, would apply to a point of time included within
the space indicated by interea. It may be mentioned here, that
Vergil osten uses interea in another sense ; namely, to denote a
transition trom one scene to another; cp. A. 1, 124 ς 10, 1 ; 11, 1.—
mediam-iter: “ AEneaS, firm of purpose, was now on his mid-sea

the latter, for less, than half. Heyne takes medium teneba't iter to
mean “ was on the high seas ;'' whilst others translate, “ was in the
middle of his voyage.'' This last translation would be inconsistent
with vs. 3.—iter tenere is common in Vergil (A. 1, 370 ; 2, 359, διο.)
corresponding to cursum tenere of Caesar and Cicero.

2-Oertus, scil, consilii ι “firm (with respect) of purpose.'’ Wagner
thinks that the meaning of certus here is derived from an arrow or
dart, hence, “unerring'' (cp. A. 11, 767 ς Hor. Od. 1, 12, 23), and
explains by recto, non erratico itinere intendens. The idea, how-
ever, seems rather to be, that the purpose of Aeneas to reach Italy
was not thwarted by the love of Dido, nor by the boisterous
weather.—fluctusque-secabczt.· “ and was cutting through the waves

Libonotus. A northern wind would be very unfavorable to any one
sailing from Karthage to Italy.

3—-Moenia, the fortified wall of a town, also, the defences on the wall
(rt. MUN, “to defend''; cp. ἁ-μὺν-ειν); muru-s (=mun·ru3‚ also
root MUN), a wall os any kind ; paries, (root PAR3 to separate), the
partition walls of a house; maceria, (root MAR, “to measure''
cp. mer-eo, μείρ-ομαι), a garden wall.

quac—flammis t “ which are all bright with the flames (of the funeral
pyre) of unhappy Elissa.'' With the force of con in collucent ‚· cp.
con-cito, con-sumo (H. 344, 53 A. ἀ G. 170 a.) Elissa was a
poetical name for Dido, derived from the Hebrew Elishah, the
name of a western race ol rnen on the coasts of the Mediterranean,
who seem to have been the descendants of Elishah, the son of
Javan, mentioned Gen. x., 4. The word would thus mean, “ west-
ern maiden'' or “ woman.'' According to Vergil, (A. 4, 45o·690)
Dido ascended the funeral pile when she intended to burn Aeneas
in effigy, and stabbed herself, and her body was burned by her
relations on that pile.
