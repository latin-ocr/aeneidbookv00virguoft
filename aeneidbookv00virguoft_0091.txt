of ὔστερον-πρότερον. —limen (akin to limes), properly, “ a thres-
hold,'' literally, “the binding thing,’' sor lay-men, “the cross
beams above and below binding the door posts,’' then, “ a begin-
ning‚'' “starting post.'’ The limen of the Roman circus was
marked by a white line (alba linea or calm). The whole space
between the alba linea and the meta was called spatium.

317—Effusi—359nant: “rushing forth like a storm cloud, at once they
mark (with their eyes) the g0a1.'’ The course appears to have
been straight throughout, so that the runners could keep their eye
on the winning post. So Nestor advises Antilochus to run αεὶ
τέρμ’ ὀρόωνε (Hom. Il. 23, 323).

BIS—Primus abit: “first takes the lead,'' literally, “first gets away '’
srom the others. The latter part of the line repeats the same idea.
Crutwell (Roman Literature p. 277) shows that Vergil as well as the
Hebrew poets often employed parallelism in their writings: see
note v. 159.

319-—Falnn’nis alis .· the thunderbolt is called by Aristophanes (Av. 1714)
πτερόφορον Διὸς βελός, “the winged bolt of Jove.'' Heyne says
(A. 4, 15) that the thunderbolt is osten represented with wings on
ancient coins. Cp. Byron's, ‘⁶ leaps the live thunder.’'

324—Ecce—Di0res: “lo! Diores flies, and now chafes toe with heeL'
Vergil evidently means that the toe of Diores carne in contact with
the heel os Helymus. This would be the meaning if, as some think
calcem calce is put first (pars pro toto) tor pedem pede.

325—Humero .- of Helymus: for the dative: H. 3863 A. & G. 228.—

326—Transeat prior : “ having shot ahead he would have passed him.'’—
Ambiquumque relinquat, scil cursum: “and would have lest the
race undecided.’' From a comp.11·ison of Hom. ΙΙ. 23, 382, we
should say that the better reading would be ambiyuumve, and that
the translation would be, “he would (either) have passed him,
having slipped ahead, or would have made the race a dead heat,''
but comparing Hom. Il. 23, 526, and some of the best MSS. of
Vergil, we should read ambiyuzcmque, and so translate, “ he would
(either) pass him, having slipped in sront, and leave him behind
who is now doubtful t ” i. e. clearly defeat him.
