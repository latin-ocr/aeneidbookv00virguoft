without, and at a sinyle point; incendere, to light from witlam
succendere, to light from beneath. The last is the usual word
to apply to a funeral py re. Vergil does not here imply that Dido
lighted her own funeral pyre. She had a funeral pyre erected under
the pretence of performing mag ic ritae to recall the love of Aeneas,
and aster ascending it, she stabbed herself with the sword Aeneas
had lest behind. (Cp. A. 4, 689.) The pyre was lighted by her
attendants.

love and fury.'’

7- lugarium: derived from avie, ‘a bird,” root GAR, “to chatter‚” (cp.
yar-rire, ‹yart-ulus, γηρυειυ), the word is applied properly to omens
obtained from the notes of birds, but also to omens derived from
any other source: auspicium (from avis, ‘a bird,'’ specio, “to
see' ') is applied to omens obtained from either the ssight of
birds or an inspection of their entrails.
