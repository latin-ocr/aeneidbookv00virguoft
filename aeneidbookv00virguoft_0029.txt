syllable, in consequence of its being separated, or cut off, as
it were, from the rest of the word in scanning the verse.
The term caesura²⁶ is also applied to the pause or stress of
the voice, which naturally rests on the caesural syllable·
The melody of the verse depends in a great measure on the
position of the caesura. The chief caesura-s in the dactylic

hexameter are ε .
(a) penthemimeralfl (at the middle of the third suot),

V. 3 2
Moenia raptorem ι quae jam inse-zema Elaeae.
(b) Hephtheminaeraffl (at the middle of the fourth fect),
V. 8:

ῡύ pelamis ιέηᾶἑτὲ νᾰίὲε Ι nec jam ‹impar-s aad.
(c) The Trochaic²⁹ (after the trochee of the third foot),
V. 184.

remeo-to Mnestheique Ι Gyan superare mcv-antem.
(d) The Bucolic Caesm-aw (at the end of the dactyl of the

foy-Tm foot when this foot is a dactyl and ends the word)=
V. 176.

Ῐρεὲ ρᾰόενηᾶσίὶῑό rector subit Ι ipse τηᾶρῖδίτὸ.

It may be observed, generally, that a verse may have one,
two or three caesuras3 that verse, however, is best divided
in which the sense pause and the caesural pause coincide, as
in each case given above.

(4) The last word in a dactylic hexameter line is for the Lastwordfn
most ‘part a dissyllable,⁸¹ or a trisyllable. A quadrisyllable ²¹²⁶ lim·
is rarely allowed, except in the case of a proper noun. Some-
times (but rarely) a monosyllable is employed at the end of a
verse, and generally in the case of est with an elision.

(5) Metricalfiyures:

(a) Elision occurs when a word ends with a vowel, diph-

thong, or with the letter -m‚ preceded by a vowel and the

This is also called the strong or mouline caesura.
