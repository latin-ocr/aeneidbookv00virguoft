The Pristis leaving the Centaurus to extricate herself from
the sunken rock, was now in pursuit of the Chimaera and
passes her. The Scylla still leads, but the crew of the Pristis
tow with such vigor that the result seems doubtful till Cloan-
thus invokes the gods to his aid. The gods listen to his
prayer, and Portunus himself gives the Scylla a mighty shove
which lands her winner. Aeneas proclaims Scylla victorious
and distributes the prizes to the first, second, and third in
the race. The Centaurus has in the meantime got off the
mek, and is paddled to the shore with broken oars, her wav-
eriug course resembling that of a snake. Sergestus is pre-
sented with a prizc.

Aeneas now leaves the shore and proceeds to a plain
enclosed with woods and hills. He invites contestants for
the footrace aud promises rewards to all, but the first three
will receive special prizes. Nisus, Euryalus, Diores, Salius,
Patron (all Trojans) and Helymus, Panopes (Sicilians) enter,
and many other competitors unnamed. Nisus is off first,
and gets the start of Salius , Euryalus is third, Helymus
fourth, after whom comes Diores. Nisus keeps the lead
until he unfortunately slips in the blood of the bullocks
slaughtered in sacrifice, but manages to struggle to his feet
just in time to upset Salius and so secure the lead to
Euryalus. The latter comes in winner, followed by Helymus
second, and Diores third. Salius is indignant at the trick
played on him and claims first prize ; with the people,
however, Euryalus is the favorite. So Salius had to be
content with a lion’s hide, and Nisus with a shield.

Aeneas proposes a boxing-match. Dares, the conqueror
of Butes, the Thracian, steps forward, but none is bold
enough to put on the knuckles with him. And accordingly
he claims the prisc—a bullock. Old Acestes angrily upbraids
Entellus, a Siciliam with cowardice. Entellus excuses him-
self on the feebleness of his age, and afterwards produces
the caestus which Eryx won in his fight with Hercules, and
offers to do battle in them. Dares refuses. Entellus then
offers to fight on equal terms and Aeneas produces a pair of
equally weighted caestus.

They commence by sparring. Dares is the quicker “on
his pins ;” Entellus, the more powerful. Hard-hitting suc-
