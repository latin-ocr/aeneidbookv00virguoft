Nautes advises Aeneas ιο take counsel with Acoeten, and

any the result of their deliberatione is, to leave in Sicily those

whom the loss of the four ships had made it impossible to
convey ιο Italy, and to choose the best of the crews to ac-
company him. Aeneas still wavers ; but his father appearing
in a vision dispels his doubts and advises him to take the

course of Nautes.

Acestes and the followers of Aeneas take off the discon-

change my mind. All the Trojans except one shall reach
Italy. '² Venus is appeased, Neptune yokes his sea- -3horses

the helm, and allow kim ιο steer. Palinurus repels the
temptet, but the god, shaking a bough steeped in the water·
of Lethe over the helmsman's temples induces him ιο sleep.
Palinurus is pushed into the sea and calls in vain for help.
Aeneas, when it is too late, discovers his loss, and steers his
own ship past the danger-cus rocks of the Sirens-
