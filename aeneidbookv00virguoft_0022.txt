estly, and with careless touches of pathos and humor, while
he floods his whole scene with that gorgeous Sicilian air like

one of Titian’s pictures, and all this is told in a language and
meti-e which shapes itselt' almost unconsciously, wave after
wave, into the most luscious joy.'’

Vergil's Eclogucs, on the other hand, can hardly be said to
be true pictures of pastoral life. His shepherds and shep-
herdesscs belong to the island of Sicily rather than to the
district of Mantua. often, too, he makes the shepherd's
dress a mere pretext for discussing some political event, or for
paying some complinient to Pollio, Varro, or Gallus. His
characters are too conventional, his representation of life too
artificial. In the Roman Eclogue we miss that individualiz-
ing of character which so strongly marks the Greek Idyl.
Still the earlier poenis of Virgil have beauties. Their melo-
dious diction, their soft and easy flowing style,¹⁶ were ad-

mired by Horace, no mean judge οἱ the poet’s art.

Dunlop divides the Eclogues into two classes z (1) those in

which, by a sort of allegor-y, some events or characters of the
time are drawn under the image of pastoral life as l, 4, 5, 10:
(2) those in which shepherds and rural soenes are really

depicted, as 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. Others divide them: (l) those
copied from Theocritus, as 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 z (2) those more
original, as 4, 6, 10.

The Geor9i08,¹⁷ in four books, was written (between B.0.
30-B.c. 37²⁸> at the request of Maecenas¹⁹ to whom tho
poem was dedicated. In this didactic Epic, Vergil copies
largely from Hesiod, Nicander, and Aratus.²⁰ While the
Eclogues have justly been regarded as inferior to the Idyls of
his Greek original, Theocritus, the (ieorgics, on the other
hand, have been accounted superior to any other poem on the
