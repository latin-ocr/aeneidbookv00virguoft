213—The Roman epic poets bestowed great elaboration on their similes.
As a mle, very few of Vergil's similes are original, being mere imi-
tations os the Greek. The simile of the hawk chasing the dove
is found in Homer ; Il. 22, 139 ; 21, 493.——commota .· “ when sud-
denly started.'’

214—0ui—nidi ε “ which has her home and sweet nestlings in the porous
rock.'' With domus, nidi, scil. suna—nidi, by metonymy put sor
“the young’' ; cp. A. 12, 475 ; nidi loquaces.

217 -Radz‘t—alas z “ she skims along her liquid way, nor moves she her
swist wings.'' The expression is generally supposed to be an imita-
tion srom Aesch. Prom. Vinct. 394, λευρὸν οἶμον αἰθέρος ψαίρει
πτεροῖς. Note the dactyls of the verse well express the rapid flight
os the dove. Similarly Vergil uses „dactyls in „describing a horse
rugining (A. 8, 596); quadrupedante patre-m sonitu quatit τὶηρίιῖἆ
σατηριινη. So Homer describing the rolling back of the stone of

220—A lto. This epithet is not to be understood as meaning that the rock
projected far out of the water, as we know it did not (vs. 124-128).
Henry takes it to refer to the rock extending from the bottom of the
sea. Conington regards the epithet as contrasting the shallowness of
the sea and the height of the rock. It is more probable that alto is
a purely ornamental epithet.

tus was “ practismg rowmg with shattered oars.'’
