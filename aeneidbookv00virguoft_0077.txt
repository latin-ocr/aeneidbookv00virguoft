[37—Intentiz' “oegerly ;'’ H. 443 ; A. 81 G. 191. Some here blame Ver-
gil for using literally and metaphorically the same word in the
same line.—eaesultanciaque—cupido ε “ the throb of excitement and
the eager desire for renown drains their beating hearts.''-haurit:
why singular? H. 463, ΙΙ. 3; A. & G. 205, b. Cp. Homer’s
11. 23, 370·1 ; πάτασσε δὲ θυμὸς ἑκάστου Νίκης ἱεμένων. According
to Homer, the contestants would be flushed in the face, while Ver-

“there was no delay.” Distinguish non and hami,- see v. 55.-

ships. The perfect in Latin (as the aorist in Greek) often indicates
the suddenness of an action t H. 471, 5; A. δι G. 279, ο. Ferit—
nauticus z “the shouts of the crew strike the sky.'' This refers to
the rowers keeping time to the portisculus, (κελεὺστης) who gives

tridentibus. The rostrum (ἕμβολος) was made of iron or brass,
wisp—threeffiointed e hence tridens. ( See woodcuts in Smith's
D1ct. 0 nt1q. p. 892). Another reading is stridentibus, which
would violate the rule of Dawes that, “ a short vowel at the end of
a word is lengthened when the following word begins with ec, op,
sq, ει.” (Misc. Crit. p. 4).

ynomic aorist of the Greek. See also note v. 140. —carcera Dis-

carceres were little cells in which the charioteers took their position.
