Vergil can hardly bc called a borrower any more than the rest
of his countrymen in other spheres of letters. The religion,
the philosophy, the very political life of the Romans, were
all of composite structure, and poetry could scarcely avoid
the eclecticism that everywhere prevailed. The object of
Vergil was to produce a national opio, by showing the vari·
ous steps of the growth of the Empire, and in doing this,
he had to give prominence to the influence oi Greek litera-
ture as an important clement in moulding Roman thought.

Vqr-5153 Vergil has been severely censured²⁴ for his deficiency in
crancoeed. the power of invention, for his intermixture of Greek and
Latin traditions, for his anachronisms, for his mode of re·
presenting the character of Aeneas, and for the sameness of

the individual characters. These are the main charges '

brought by his detractor& and granting the full indictment
brought against the poem, Vergil still has the proud claim
of being one of the greatest of epic poets. No doubt his
power of invention is less than Homer’s, no doubt he did
intermingle the traditions of Greece and those of Rome, (for
this, as we have remarked, could hardly be otherwise in his
age), no doubt he did commit the heinous crime of anachron-
ism, but he sins in this along with Shakespeare and Milton,
and there is no doubt that this hero Aeneas is cold-blooded
and uninteresting. These defects, however, are far more
than counterbalanced by his many excellencies. “There is
in Vergil a great tenderness of feeling, something better and
more charming than mere Roman 'virtue or morality. That
he excels in pathos, as Homer in sublimity, is an old
opinion, and it is surely the right one. This pathos is given
at times by a single epithet‚ by a slight touch, with graceful
art by an indirect allusion 3 this tenderness is more striking
as contrasted with the stern Roman character and with the
stately majesty of the verse. The poet never becomes
affected or sentimental 3 he hardly ever offends against good
taste ; he knows where to stop ; he is excellent in his silence
as well as in his speech ; Vergil, as Wordsworth says, is a
master of language, but no one can really be a master of
language unless he be also a master oi thought of which
language is the expression.”
