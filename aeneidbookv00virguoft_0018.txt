His-mdia Vergil began his studies at Cremona, where, we are told,

mne he assumed the coya virilis on the same day on which
Lucretius died. The town itself had already been noted,
having been the birthplace of Furius Bibaculus, and of the
critic, Quinctilius Varro.

After a brief stay at Cremona, and subsequently at Medio-
toRomae, lanum (Milan), the poet went to Rome. In the capital,
’ Vergil, aster the fashion of the day, attended the lectores
of rhetoricians and philosophers. Under Epidius, the rhe-
tor-ician, the teacher of Marc Ant‹›uy and afterwards of
Octavius, and under the Epicurean philosopher, Siron, the
poet became acquainted with the outlines of rhetoric and
philosophy. It is quite probable that his father intended him
for the bar, but a weak voice and a diffident manner were in·
superable barriers in the way of obtaining distinction in
public speaking. Vergil soon gave up rhetoric, and, in fact
renounced poetry for the more congenial study os philosophy.
Under Siron, he seems to have made considerable progress in
Epicurean philosophy, and the love he retained for this branch
of learning is plainly observablc in many of his extant
writings.⁴ In a minor poem, generally supposed to be genuine,
he welcomes the exchange of poetry and rhetoric for more
useful studies ε’

“ Away with you, empty coloured flagons of the rhetori-
cians, words swollen, but not with the dews of Greece ; and,
away with you, Stilo, Tagitius and Varro, you, nation of
pedants, soaking with fat : you, empty cymbals of the class·
room. Farewell‚ too, Sabinus, friend of all my friends ; noim,
farewell, all my beautiful companions, we are set-ting our
sails for a haven of bliss‚ going to hear the learned words of
the great Siron, and we mean to redeem our life from all
distraction. Farewell, too, sweet Muses; for, to tell the
truth, I have found how sweet you were ι and yet, I pray
yon, look on my pages again, but with modesty and at rare
intervals.''⁶

oon eo After a short stay at Rome Vergil probably wentto Naples
Nupta. where, we are told, Parthenius, another Epicurean, was his ”
instructor. The great Epic⁶ of Lucretius, added to the
