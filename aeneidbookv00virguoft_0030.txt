following word begins with a vowel‚ a diphthong‚ or the
letter h. When such is the case the last syllable of the word
so ending with a vowel, diphthong, or the letter ·m preceded
by a vowel is elided, ie.. struck out altogether, and in scansion
is not regarded as a part of the verse ε e.g., V. 1, 2 2

interea noedtum lienem jeim cla-ss& tenebat:
Οὲνίῠε uer, stacta-sque atr6³ aquaeue secabat.

In theselines, ·um in medium is elided before Ae, in Aeneas
and the final ·e in que is elided before atros.

(b) The non-elision of the final vowel or diphthong before·
an initial vowel or diphthong, is called a hiacus. of this
we have two cases in B.V.: 261. 735 3

(1) Victor ᾱρᾱᾱ rapidam Βῑηιόεηιᾰ sab Ϊῐῑό alto ;
(2) cananum Ειμῖῑᾱηιφιε coza. Hac casta >thyla

The first hiatus may be explained by the fact that the long
vowel in the end, especially in the case of a proper name
is shortened. In the second, the sense pause prevents the
elision (cp. Vergil's Ecl. ΙΙ., 53). In the case of proper names,
and especially of Greek proper names, considerable license
is allowed in the arsia of the foot.

(e) Synaeresis is defined as the union of two vowels
which should properly form separate syllables ι 22 in
ἐπὶ, ei ; Pheqem ,· Mnesthei. This figure is sometimes called
Shnizesie.

(d) Synaphaeia is the principle of continuon- scansion. It
sometimes happens that a final vowel, dipthong, or -m pre.
eeded by a vowel at the end of a line is elided before the initial
vowel, diphthong, or h of the next line: e.g: (a) -ν, 422. Ec

Myrtos membrorum arta-s mdqna ῦεεᾶ lacertosque Mu,
In this line -que is struck out before mit.

v. 753. Robora ηαυῐρϊίε aptam remosque ridentes que
mmm.

So also in this line. There are altogether tventyffim
hypermetrical lines in Vergil. ·

(e) Ictus is the beat of the foot which corresponde- with
the elevation of the voice (ἄρσις). This naturally falls ⁰¹²„ the
