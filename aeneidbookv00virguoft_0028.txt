METRE.

The Aeneid is written in the heroic metre of the Romans,
viz.: the dactylic hexameter. This was the most ancient
as well as the most dignified form of verse among the Greeks
and Romans. It was cultivated at a period far beyond
the beginnings of authentic history, as we find it in its most
perfect shape in the poems of Homer and Hesiod, and the
responses οἱ the Delphic oracle. Ennius is said to have dis·
carded the rude Saturnian metre of his predecessore, and to
have introduced the hexameter among the Romans. Vergil

is generally considered as the model of this kind of verse
among the Latins.

The dactylic hexameter consists, as its name implies,
of six feet, the first four of which may be dactyls or
spondees; the fifth is usually a dactyl‚ and the sixth in·

variably a spondee. The following is the scheme t

[— -1

(l) For the comparative number of dactyls and spondees
in the first four places no definite rule can be given. Gener·
ally speaking, the line is more smooth when the arrangement
is varied, to avoid monotony. A succession of dactyls may

be used for special reasons, e.g. to describe rapid motion, ss
in V. 217, where the swift ssight of the dove is described ε

Rada lter liquidam, celares nequ& commovet ᾰῑᾶε.

On the other hand, a suecessiou of spondees may be
employed to describe a laboured effort, V. 204 ς

Ynsezia: saxis επ ρνῡσῡπᾱηιῑὸᾰε ham.
(2) Rarely the fifth foot is a spondee, in which case the
line is called a apondaicfi line ε e. g. B. V. 761 ε
Σο laces crue· edelr ᾰάάαῦν Anchiseo.
(3) When the last syllable of word remains over, after
the comple-tion of a foot, that syllable is called a caesui-al
