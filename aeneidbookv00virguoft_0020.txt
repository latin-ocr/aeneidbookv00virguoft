Through the mnnificent kindness of his patrous he was
raised to luxury and affluence. He had a magnificent house
in Rome on the Esquiline near the residences of Horace and
Maecenas, estates in Sicily, and in Campania, near Naples.
The mild elimate and clear skies of Southern Italy suited his
delicate constitution, and till his death, his Campanian resi·
dence was his favorite abode.⁹ From the date of his early
Eclogues till his death, little need be said of his life except
that he devoted himself to study and to the completion of
his immortal works. In the year B.C. 19, he went to
Greece, possibly with a view ιο restore his health, and ιο
give a finish ιο his great work, the Aeneid. At Athens he
met Augustus who had just returned from Samos. Vergil
returned to Italy in company with the emperor, but died at
Brundisium three days after he lauded, 22nd September,
19 B.C. He was buried near Naples, on the road leading to
Puteoli (Puzzuola'). His epitaph, said to have been dictated
by himself in his last momenta, was as follows 2—-

Mantua me ymniz: Calabri rapuere,- tenet mmo
Parthenope. cecini pascua, rura, ductam

Vergil is generally described as of tall stature, delicate
(rame, homely features, and dark complexion‚ abstinent in
the use of food‚ shy, and fond of retirement. Horace is said
to have had Vergil in his mind's eye when he wrote¹¹ the
lines thus rendered by Conington ε

“ The man is passionate, perhaps misplaced
In soeial circles 01 fastidious taste ς
His ill-trimmed heard, his dress of unoouth style,
His shoes ἰ11-ίίίιιιιηζ.ἰ may provoke a smne:

But he's the soul ot virtue ς but he’s kind
But that coarse body hides a mighty mind?

He was so pure and chaste that the N eapolitans gave him

the name of Parthenias, or the maiden ¹² He is said to
have been shy and even awkward in society, and these traits

Parthenope, studiis florentem sonabilis oti.
