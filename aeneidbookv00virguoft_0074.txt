to the place which had the resemblance of a Roman εἰναι-Μανι-
tur. So Homer represents the prizes as placed before the combat-
ants-dyad’czeoza ἔθηκε (ΙΙ. 23, 262-3).

llo-Sacri—coronae. Tripods were osten given as a prize at gymnastic
contests (11. 23, 264). They were called sacri from their frequent
use in sacrifices In the subsequent enumeration of prizes there is
no mention made of tripods. but we find crowns given. Horace
mentions tripods as a usual prize at Greek games ; donarem tripoda-s
praemia sortium Graiorum (Hor. Od. IV, 8, 3, 4). Crowns were
awarded to the victors at all the sour principal festivals os the
Greeks and as Roman military prizes.

Ill—Palmae: (see vs. 70).—ostro : “the blood of the sea-snail'' (murex
Tyriu⁸): from which the celebrated Tyrian purple was obtained.

112—Persu8ae: “dyed.’' Aryenti—talenta: “talents (one) of silver and
(one) of gold.’' The talentum in Vergil is a weight nota coin,
Homer mentions two gold talents among the prizes: δύω χρυσοῖο
τάλαντα (11. 23, 259). For the gen. see H. 397, I.; A. &G 214, e.

llss—Et—ludost “and the trumpet announces from the mound in the
centre (of the company) that the games had begun.'’ The use oi
the trumpet as the signal for battle is post-Homeric. Only once
does Homer mention a trumpet and that in asimile(11. 18, 219).
The trumpet served to announce the ludi Circenses at Rome, so
that Vergil is here deseribing the customs of his own time. Dis-
tinguish tuba, a long, straight trumpet used sor infantry3 cornu,
a trumpet, crooked like the letter C and used for cavalry and
infantry ; lituus, a trumpet like a shepherd's staff ι. and used sor
cavalry.

114—primo—carinae: “four well-matched ships, with ponderous oars,
picked from the whole fleet, enter the first contest.'' Pares ι equal in
swiftness, though lleyne refers it to speed and size. The Chimaera
was, however, evidently larger than the others—certamina. Ex-
plain this case: H. 3723 A. & G. 237, d. Mnestheus —Vergil is
fond of tracing the ancestry of the noble families os Rome from a
Trojan source. He evidently derives Mnestheus from μεμυῆσθαι, as
Memmius in the next line from memini. Vergil and especially Ovid
were very sanciful in their derivations.——Acri—remi9e: ‘⁶ with his
active crew.'' Here the singular is put sor the plural ς so in A. 4,
588: Vacuoe sensit sine rem-isle portas—Pristim: the nom. is
variously given: Pristis, Pistris, Pistrix. Pristriae, asea monster:
see A. 3, 427. Among the Romans the ships seem to have de·
rived their names srorn the figure-heads as in the present case, or
from various affections as Spes, Concordia, Victoria, or from the
names of countries‚ cities, towns, and islands as Parthia, Syracusae,
Delia, M incius. The Greeks, on the other hand, called their ships
after heroines as Ναυσικάα, or from abstract terms, πρόνοια, θεραπεια,
maora. Notice that the name of a ship is feminine, taking its
gender from the generic, navis.

117—Genu3—Memmi: either ‘¹ from whom a family by the name of Mem·
mins,'' or “ Memmii by name.'’ In the first translation Memmi i:
